# ==== Collection Framework in Java ====
The Java Collection Framework was introduced in Java 1.2, also known as Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE). It was a significant addition to the Java platform and provided a set of interfaces, classes, and algorithms to represent and manipulate collections of objects. The Collection Framework introduced concepts such as lists, sets, queues, maps, iterators, and algorithms for common operations on collections. It greatly simplified the process of working with collections in Java and improved code reuse and maintainability.
